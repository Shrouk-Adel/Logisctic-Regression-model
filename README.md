# Logisctic-Regression-model
Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis, 
but it differs from traditional linear regression in that it
is used to predict a categorical outcome, rather than a continuous one.
In linear regression, the predicted outcome is a linear function of 
the independent variables.In logistic regression, the predicted outcome
is a probability, and is calculated using the logistic function.

The logistic function is a sigmoid function that takes a real number as input and returns
a value between 0 and 1. This means that the logistic function can be used
to model the probability of an event occurring.
